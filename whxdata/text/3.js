rh._.exports({"0":[["n_about"]],"1":[[" ","About This Guide","This ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Network Configuration Guide"," describes basic attributes of your switch and basic switch administration tasks. The software features described in this manual are shipped standard with your switches. These features are used when readying a switch for integration into a live network environment.","Supported Platforms","The information in this guide applies only to the following products:","•    ","OmniSwitch 6360"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6465"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6560"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6570M"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6860"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6865"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 6900"," Series","•    ","OmniSwitch 9900"," Series","Who Should Read this Manual?","The audience for this user guide are network administrators and IT support personnel who need to configure, maintain, and monitor switches and routers in a live network. However, anyone wishing to gain knowledge on how fundamental software features are implemented in the OmniSwitch Series switches will benefit from the material in this configuration guide.","When Should I Read this Manual?","Read this guide as soon as your switch is up and running and you are ready to familiarize yourself with basic software functions. You should have already stepped through the first login procedures and read the brief software overviews in the appropriate Hardware Users Guide. ","You should have already set up a switch password and be familiar with the very basics of the switch software. This manual will help you understand the switch’s directory structure, the Command Line Interface (CLI), configuration files, basic security features, and basic administrative functions. The features and procedures in this guide will help form a foundation that will allow you to configure more advanced switching features later.","What is in this Manual?","This configuration guide includes information about the following features:","•    ","Basic switch administrative features, such as file editing utilities, procedures for loading new software, and setting up system information (name of switch, date, time).","•    ","Configurations files, including snapshots, off-line configuration, time-activated file download.","•    ","The CLI, including on-line configuration, command-building help, syntax error checking, and line editing.","•    ","Basic security features, such as switch access control and customized user accounts.","•    ","SNMP","•    ","Web-based management (WebView)","What is Not in this Manual?","The configuration procedures in this manual primarily use Command Line Interface (CLI) commands in examples. CLI commands are text-based commands used to manage the switch through serial (console port) connections or via Telnet sessions. This guide does include introductory chapters for alternative methods of managing the switch, such as web-based (WebView) and SNMP management. However the primary focus of this guide is managing the switch through the CLI.","Further information on WebView can be found in the context-sensitive on-line help available with that application.","This guide does not include documentation for the OmniVista network management system. However, OmniVista includes a complete context-sensitive on-line help system.","This guide provides overview material on software features, how-to procedures, and tutorials that will enable you to begin configuring your OmniSwitch. However, it is not intended as a comprehensive reference to all CLI commands available in the OmniSwitch. For such a reference to all CLI commands, consult the ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 CLI Reference Guide",".","How is the Information Organized?","Each chapter in this guide includes sections that will satisfy the information requirements of casual readers, rushed readers, serious detail-oriented readers, advanced users, and beginning users.","Quick Information",". Most chapters include a ","specifications table"," that lists RFCs and IEEE specifications supported by the software feature. In addition, this table includes other pertinent information such as minimum and maximum values and sub-feature support. Some chapters include a ","defaults table"," that lists the default values for important parameters along with the CLI command used to configure the parameter. Many chapters include ","Quick Steps"," sections, which are procedures covering the basic steps required to get a software feature up and running.","In-Depth Information",". All chapters include ","overview sections"," on software features as well as on selected topics of that software feature. ","Topical sections"," may often lead into ","procedure sections"," that describe how to configure the feature just described. Many chapters include ","tutorials"," or ","application examples"," that help convey how CLI commands can be used together to set up a particular feature.","Documentation Roadmap","The OmniSwitch user documentation suite was designed to supply you with information at several critical junctures of the configuration process.The following section outlines a roadmap of the manuals that will help you at each stage of the configuration process. Under each stage, we point you to the manual or manuals that will be most helpful to you.","Stage 1: Using the Switch for the First Time","Pertinent Documentation:"," ","OmniSwitch Hardware Users Guide","Release Notes","This guide provides all the information you need to get your switch up and running the first time.
