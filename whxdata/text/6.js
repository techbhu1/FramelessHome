Anyone wishing to gain knowledge on the details of all CLI commands available on the OmniSwitch will benefit from the material in this reference guide. However, advanced users who have already familiarized themselves with the OmniSwitch CLI commands will benefit most from the detailed content in this guide.","When Should I Read this Manual?","Read this guide whenever you want detailed information on individual CLI commands. Although this guide provides helpful information during any stage of the configuration process, it is a good idea to first familiarize yourself with the software features available on the switch before investigating the detailed command information in this guide. ","Overview information, procedures, and live network examples on switch software features can be found in the ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Switch Management Guide",", ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Network Configuration Guide",","," ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Advanced Routing Configuration Guide",", and ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Data Center Switching Guide",". Once you are familiar with the procedures and base CLI commands in these configuration guides you can obtain more detailed information on the individual commands in this guide.","What is in this Manual?","This reference guide includes information on every CLI command available in the switch. Command reference information is included for base software commands as well as commands associated with optional software packages, such as Advanced Routing (multicast routing protocols and OSPF). The information provided for each CLI command includes:","•    ","Command description.","•    ","Syntax.","•    ","Description of all keywords and variables included in the syntax.","•    ","Default values.","•    ","Usage guidelines, which include tips on when and how to use the command.","•    ","Examples of command lines using the command.","•    ","Related commands with descriptions.","•    ","Release history, which indicates the release when the command was introduced.","•    ","SNMP information, such as the MIB files related to a set of CLI commands.

It also does not provide overview or application examples on software features. For comprehensive information on how to configure particular software features in the switch, consult the appropriate configuration guide.","This guide also does not provide any information on the network management applications, WebView and OmniVista. Further information on WebView and OmniVista can be found in the context-sensitive on-line help available with those applications.","How is the Information Organized?","Each chapter in this guide includes reference material for all commands related to a single software feature, such as server load balancing or link aggregation. Typically commands in a single chapter will share a common prefix.","Text Conventions","The following table contains text conventions and usage guidelines for CLI commands as they are documented in this guide",".","bold text","Indicates basic command and keyword syntax.","Example: ","show snmp station","italicized text","Indicates user-specific information such as IP addresses, slot numbers, passwords, names, etc.","Example: ","no snmp station ","ip_address","Italicized text that is not enclosed with straight brackets (","[ ]",")"," indicates required information.","[ ]"," (Straight Brackets)","Indicates optional parameters for a given command.","Example: ","show aaa server"," ","[","server_name","]","Here, you can enter either of the following options:","show aaa server","show aaa server ","server_name"," (where ","server_name"," is the user-specified server name, e.g., ","show aaa server myserver1",")","Note that this example includes"," italicized text",". The optional parameter in this case is a user-specified server name.","{ }"," ","(Curly Braces)","Indicates that the user must choose between one or more parameters.","Example: ","port mirroring {enable | disable}","Here, you must choose one of the following:","port mirroring enable ","or"," ","port mirroring disable","|"," ","(Vertical Pipes)","Used to separate parameter choices within a command string. For","example, the command string","show health threshold [rx | txrx | memory | cpu]","separates the choices ","rx",", ","txrx",", ","memory, ","and ","cpu",".","Examples:","show health threshold rx","show health threshold txrx","show health threshold memory","show health threshold cpu","“ ”"," ","(Quotation Marks)","Used to enclose text strings that contain spaces. The quotation marks are required input on the command line.","Example: ","vlan 2 “new test vlan”","Documentation Roadmap","The OmniSwitch user documentation suite was designed to supply you with information at several critical junctures of the configuration process.The following section outlines a roadmap of the manuals that will help you at each stage of the configuration process.
