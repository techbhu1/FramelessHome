A VLAN defines a broadcast domain that contains physical ports and can span across multiple switches. All switches contain a default VLAN 1. Physical switch ports are initially assigned to VLAN 1 until they are statically or dynamically assigned to other VLANs. ","This chapter includes descriptions of VLAN management commands used to create, modify or remove VLANs. These commands allow you to enable or disable Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), add or remove virtual router interfaces, statically assign physical switch ports to a default VLAN, and display VLAN configuration information.

For example, port 1/1/2 must belong to either all Primary VLANs, all Isolated Secondary VLANs, or all Community Secondary VLANs.","–    ","Each VLAN tagged on the port must belong to a different PVLAN domain.
