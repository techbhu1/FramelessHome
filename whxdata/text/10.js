rh._.exports({"0":[["c_udld"]],"1":[[" ","3    ","UDLD Commands","This chapter describes the CLI commands used to configure the ","UDLD (UniDirectional Link Detection) protocol. UDLD operates at Layer 2 in conjunction with IEEE 802.3 Layer 1 fault detection mechanism. It is a protocol used for detecting and disabling unidirectional Ethernet fiber or copper connections to avoid interface malfunctions, Spanning Tree loops, media faults, and so on. It operates in two main modes normal and aggressive. "," The two basic mechanisms that UDLD follows are:","•    ","Advertises port identity and learns about its neighbors. This information is maintained in a cache table.","•    ","It sends continuous echo messages when fast notifications are required.","MIB information for the UDLD commands is as follows:","Filename",":   ALCATEL-IND1-UDLD-MIB.mib","Module",":   alcatelIND1UDLDMIB","A summary of available commands is listed here:","udld","udld port","udld mode","udld probe-timer","udld echo-wait-timer","clear udld statistics port","show udld configuration","show udld configuration port","show udld statistics port","show udld neighbor port","show udld status port","Configuration procedures for UDLD are explained in “Configuring UDLD,”"," ","OmniSwitch AOS Release 8 Network Configuration Guide",".","udld","Globally"," ","enables or disables UDLD protocol on the switch.","udld {enable | disable}","Syntax Definitions","enable","Globally enables UDLD on the switch.","disable","Globally disables UDLD on the switch.","Defaults","parameter","default","enable | disable ","disable","Platforms Supported","This command is supported on the following OmniSwitch platforms:","6360","6465","6560","6570M","6860","6860N","6865","6900","6900","V72/C32","6900","X48C6/T48C6/X48C4E/V48C8/C32E/T24C2/X24C2","9900","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","Usage Guidelines","•    ","Auto-negotiation should be disabled on both ends of the link for UDLD to operate properly. ","•    ","The port shutdown by this command can be reset by using the ","interfaces admin"," command.","Examples","-> udld enable","-> udld disable","Release History","Release 7.1.1;
